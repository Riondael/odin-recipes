    <h2 class="bckgrColor">Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for the <em>Classic</em> <strong>Grilled Cheese Sandwich</strong></p>
    <p>Everyone knows that the grilled cheese is a classic recipe, due to it's simple and delicious punch! There are a few reasons why you'll love this recipe.</p>
    <p>First of all, it's <em>cheap</em> and easy to make. My favorite type is using the <strong>Kraft American Singles</strong> due to how cheap they are, but they're also <em>delicious</em>. 
        This recipe is not just good because it's cheap and delicious though. It's also great because you can add whatever cheese you would like, as well as the type of bread.
        You could get as fancy as using <strong>cheddar</strong>, but you could also use <strong>mozzarella</strong>. Now, some cheese is better for use due to its' melting capabilities. 
        This is why I prefer the Kraft Singles.
        Bread is also a factor. You can use <em>whole-grain</em>, <em>white</em>, or <strong>whatever</strong> type you'd like. Although, for <em>this</em> recipe (due to simplicity reasons), 
        we will be sticking with <em>my</em> version of a good grilled cheese sandwich!

    <h3 class="xtraLarge-mono bckgrColor">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Two slices of White Bread</li>
        <li>2 tsp. of Salted Butter</li>
        <li>2 Slices of Kraft American Singles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="xtraLarge-mono bckgrColor">Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Heat</em> your pan on medium-high for 3 minutes</li>
        <li>While your pan is heating, <em>butter</em> both slices of bread on one side</li>
        <li>Once the pan has heated, <em>add one slice of bread</em> onto the pan (<strong>butter side down</strong>). Then <em>stack the slices of cheese on top, followed by the last slice of bread</em> (<strong>butter side up</strong>)</li>
        <li><em>Push down on the sandwich</em> using a <strong>spatula</strong> in order to allow the cheese to melt more quickly</li>
        <li><em>Allow the sandwich to brown</em> on one side, <em>then flip and repeat</em> the browning process.</li>
        <li>Once both sides are brown and crisp, <strong>ensure<strong> that the cheese is melted to your own liking, and serve!</li>
