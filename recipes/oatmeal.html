        <p>This is a recipe for <strong>Oatmeal</strong>. It's a simple recipe and can be made as long as you have <em>oats</em>, and <em>water</em>; but if you're looking for flavor, that can be 
            adjusted using a few simple ingredients such as cinnamon, and brown sugar. For this recipe, we will be using <em>milk</em> instead of water, and adding a few extra things to make the flavor 
            really <em>pop!</em>
