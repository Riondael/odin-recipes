        <p>This is a recipe for a <em>simple </em>bowl of Cereal</p>
        <p>Cereal can be a great start to your day, <em>depending</em> on the type of cereal you choose. If you're going for a <strong>healthy</strong> breakfast, there are a few types of cereal
        you might want to choose from. There will be a list of types you might want below, followed by how to make them. Otherwise, you might want a <em>sugary</em> concoction that will taste
         like you're on a rainbow. There are also a few options listed below. Just choose your type and follow the steps below to make a delicious bowl of cereal!
         </p>
        <h2 class="large-mono">Healthy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Honey Nut Cheerios</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Raisin Bran</strong>(<em>My favorite</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Corn Flakes</strong></li>
            <p>Side Note: All of these choices are filled with <strong>Fiber</strong> and can help you feel full longer. Cheerios also boast that they're heart healthy, but take that with a grain of salt.</p>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="large-mono">Sugary</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Frosted Flakes</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Captain Crunch</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Reese's Puffs</strong></li>
            <p>Side Note: Be wary of eating too much of these as it can lead to pallette fatigue and you could also crash from all the sugar. Eat at your own discretion.</p>
        </ul>
