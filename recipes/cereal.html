                <h2 class="large-mono">Healthy</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Honey Nut Cheerios</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Raisin Bran</strong>(<em>My favorite</em>)</li>
                    <li><strong>Corn Flakes</strong></li>            
                </ul>
                </div>
                <p class="content-panel">Side Note: All of these choices are filled with <strong>Fiber</strong> and can help you feel full longer. Cheerios also boast that they're heart healthy, but take that with a grain of salt.</p>
                <div class="content-panel">
                <h2 class="large-mono">Sugary</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Frosted Flakes</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Captain Crunch</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Reese's Puffs</strong></li>            
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="content-panel">Side Note: Be wary of eating too much of these as it can lead to pallette fatigue and you could also crash from all the sugar. Eat at your own discretion.</p>
