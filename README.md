# odin-recipes
A project following the OdinProject foundations course.

In this project I will be utilizing what I have learned so far in HTML code.
This will be things such as:
Setting up a boilerplate;
Making titles throughout the webpages using 'h1-6';
Utilizing Lists (Both ordered: 'ol' and unordered: 'ul');
Writing paragraphs using the 'p' element;
Emphasizing and strengthening text using the 'em' and 'str' elements, respectively;
Linking to other relative webpages using the 'a' element (as well as absolute paths);
Other methods I have either not learned or am forgetting, but this file will be re-committed with revisions if I remember them.
