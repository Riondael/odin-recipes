# odin-recipes
A project following the OdinProject foundations course.

In this project I will be utilizing what I have learned so far in HTML code.
This will be things such as:
Setting up a boilerplate;
Making titles throughout the webpages using 'h1-6';
Utilizing Lists (Both ordered: 'ol' and unordered: 'ul');
Writing paragraphs using the 'p' element;
Emphasizing and strengthening text using the 'em' and 'str' elements, respectively;
Linking to other relative webpages using the 'a' element (as well as absolute paths);
Other methods I have either not learned or am forgetting, but this file will be re-committed with revisions if I remember them.

Update 2:
I forgot to update the readme for the last few changes. But after reviewing the GitHub commit logs, it looks like all changes were made on 02/06/2024 and they
mostly included the addition of the CSS stylesheet, more specifically they included changes to the text font-family as well as font-style changes, same goes for the font-sizes.
The only other changes made were the align the text to center and the changing of color on screen.

Update 3 (02/08/2024):
Changes made with this new update, are the changing of stylistic choice on the page. This included using div containers in order to make panels, and panels within those panels. I utilized
padding, margin, and border properties to make the page more visually appealing, as well as to create a more structured looking page. I think it made it look like the page was made out of stamps, which is pretty cool. I also utilized display options, mostly using flexbox.
